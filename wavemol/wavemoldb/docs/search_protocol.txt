** Search query protocol **

we use a GET query to obtain the uri's of the entities matching the criteria. The GET endpoint is at /search

The following parameters must be passed in the GET query (here shown in a non-encoded form)

type=ajax 
filters=n:filter_id:arg1:arg2,n:filter_id:arg1:arg2,...
limit=number
offset=number

where n are incrementing numbers, filter_id is a string that identifies the filter to use for the query, and arg1,arg2 etc are the arguments for that particular filter.
multiple filters can be chained using a comma separator.

example (non-encoded for clarity): type=ajax&filters=0:rdf__type:wmnt__Molecule,1:wm__structure_type:wmst__ts

** returned information **

A JSON encoded entity is returned, with two keys:

total
    contains the total number of matches in the database

uri_list
    a list of strings, each being a urn:uuid: of the entity that matched.
    Note that the length of this entity can be different from total. While total
    represents the total matching entries in the database, uri_list can be limited.

offset
    reports the offset in the database where the entries are found. This entry is optional.

limit 
    reports the max number of entries reported (requested or imposed by the server). 
    note that the length of uri_list can be at maximum the length of this limit, but it
    can be shorter if less data are available. Also note that limit can be smaller than the 
    requested if the server consider the request to be larger than appropriate.
